# mlr3learners.template

This packages provides a template for adding new learners for [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com).

Creating new learners is covered in section ["Adding new learners"](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/extending-learners.html) in the mlr3book.
This package serves as a starting point for learners to share with others.

## Instructions

This repository is a template repository to create a learner that aligns with existing mlr3 learners.
Perform the following tasks to create your learner:

1. Replace all instances of
   1. `<package>` with the name of the underlying package.
   1. `<type>` with the learner type, e.g. `Classif` or `Regr`.
   1. `<algorithm>` with the name of the algorithm, e.g `randomForest`.
1. Rename files following the same scheme as in 1).
1. Check if the learner supports feature importance internally.
   If yes, add a `importance()` method in the respective learner class.
1. Check if the learner supports out-of-bag error estimation internally.
   If yes, add a `oob_error()` method in the respective learner class.
1. Add yourself as the maintainer in `DESCRIPTION`.
1. Set up Continuous Integration (CI).
   The GitHub Actions YAML files live in `.github/workflows`.
   1. Replace `<package>` in l.13 of `tic.R` with the name of the package.
   1. Update the "Paramtest" files in `inst/paramtest/` to ensure no parameter was forgotten in the learner.
      Make sure that the CI test passes for "Param Check".
   1. Update the badge in `README.md` with the package name.
1. Run `devtools::document(roclets = c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace'))` to create the NAMESPACE and man/ files.
1. Leave the files in `man-roxygen` as they are - they will just work.
1. Run `usethis::use_tidy_description()` to format `DESCRIPTION`.
1. Test your learner locally by running `devtools::test()`
1. Check your package by running `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()`
1. Check if your learner complies with the [mlr style guide](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Style-Guide).
1. Ensure that the CI builds complete successfully (via the "Actions" menu in the repo).

After your learner is accepted, it can be added to [mlr3learners.drat](https://github.com/mlr3learners/mlr3learners.drat), making it installabe via the canonical `install.packages()` function without the need to live on CRAN.

**!Important!**: Delete all instructions up to this point and just leave the part below.
